# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   In my project, I created a painting of a creeper face using methods containing selection, iteration, and sequencing. By using multiple methods, my two painters were able to navigate and paint both the backgroun and the actual creeper face. Comments are also scattered around the 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   Two things that I am proud of for my project are the organization/cleanliness of my code and the persevearance I had when coding. Rather than using more individual steps, I challenged myself to create more complex/cleaner code. Therefore, I used more selection/iteration statements than I originally intended. This made the process more time consuming (with testing and debugging). So, I had to persevere through many errors and keep testing before finally being satisfied with my final product. As a result, since there were less lines of code, more comments explaining the process, and careful spacing, the code became more organized and easier to navigate.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   If I had the opportunity to change/improve my project, I would add more complexity to my painting. Rather than having a plain green background, I would like to alternate between a darker and light green to make it more appealing and complex. I would also like to add more complexity to the creeper face, such as adding a sparkle to the eye or experimenting with different mouth structures.
